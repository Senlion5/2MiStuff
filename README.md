# 2MiStuff 1.1 | Mobile App for iOS and Android

> A Marketplace of Things: handmade, restorated and secondhand item categories

2MiStuff is an entirely functional mobile application made in React Native. Upload the pictures of the stuff you want to sell, put them in the appropriate category and let a buyer contact you. Notifications and messaging are also totally functional. The early version 1.0 of the app was published at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.senlion5.twomistuff). The current version 1.1 has live mapping of locations and can be experienced via [Expo](https://expo.io/@senlion5/projects/2MiStuff). The backend is built with Node.js (TypeScript) and Express, connected to MongoDB and images stored at AWS Cloud S3. So, I had a lot of fun, and itâ€™s only to demonstrate my software engineering skills. I also hope you will enjoy my project.
