# 2MiStuff 1.1 | Mobile App for iOS and Android

> A Marketplace of Things: handmade, restorated and secondhand item categories

2MiStuff is a full stack, entirely functional mobile application made in React Native (TypeScript). Make pictures of the stuff you want to sell, upload them, assign them to the appropriate category and let a buyer contact you! Notifications and messaging are also totally functional. This version of the app has live mapping of locations. The backend is built with Node.js (also TypeScript) and Express, connected to MongoDB and images stored at AWS Cloud S3. 2MiStuff can be experienced via [Expo](https://expo.io/@senlion5/projects/2MiStuff). This demo project is a part of the software developerâ€™s professional portfolio.
